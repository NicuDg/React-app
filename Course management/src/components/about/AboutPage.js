      Everything about us means experience, an experience valued and harnessed
      by more than 30 graduated classes. Today, over 600 students attend the
      specialization lectures that cover a large application spectrum of the
      acquired knowledge.<br></br> The teaching staff, prepared to a high
      standard, successfully interweaves youthful enthusiasm and experience, the
      age average being around 39 years. The passion for discovery, experiment
      and study, the continuous desire to be a part of the technological
      development and growth, and the openness toward interpersonal
      communication are the strengths of our representatives.<br></br> What will
      you learn with us? Several examples are listed, next:<br></br> -Computer
      Aided Process Control <br></br>-Application Oriented Programming Languages
      Computer Aided Design Process Modelling and Simulation Electronics basics
      and electronic circuit design Robot Control Systems and Computer
      Integrated Manufacturing Data Transmission Above all, the Automation field
      represents a form of knowledge. The term describes one of those areas that
      luckily intertwine dedication and professionalism, and the joy of
      understanding the interaction complexity between system components,
      created by man or nature, at micro and macro scale .
